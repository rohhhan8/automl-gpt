cd automl-saas-platform
```

### 2. Supabase Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your project URL and anon key
3. Run the database migration to set up tables

### 3. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 4. Install Dependencies and Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## 🎨 UI Components

The frontend includes a comprehensive set of reusable components:

- **Authentication**: Login/signup forms with validation
- **Dashboard**: Job management and statistics
- **Job Status**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Results**: Model performance visualization
- **Navigation**: Responsive header with dark mode toggle
- **Registration Popups**: Early access registration forms
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supabase Database Schema
The platform uses the following main tables:
- `profiles`: User profile information
